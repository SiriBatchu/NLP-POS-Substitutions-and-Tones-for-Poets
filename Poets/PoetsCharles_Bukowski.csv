there is a loneliness in this world so great

people just are not good to each other

the rich are not good to the rich

we are afraid. 

our educational system tells us
that we can all be
big-ass winners.

it hasn't told us
about the gutters
or the suicides. 

or the terror of one person
aching in one place
alone 

untouched
unspoken to 

watering a plant. 

people are not good to each other.

I suppose they never will be.
I don't ask them to be.

it. 

the beads will swing
the clouds will cloud
and the killer will behead the child

perhaps if they were

terrorized
a white cross-eyed tailless cat
I took him in and fed him and he stayed 
grew to trust me until a friend drove up the driveway
and ran him over
I took what was left to a vet who said,""not much
chance…give him these pills…his backbone
is crushed, but is was crushed before and somehow
mended, if he lives he'll never walk, look at
these x-rays, he's been shot, look here, the pellets
are still there…also, he once had a tail, somebody
cut it off…"" 
I took the cat back, it was a hot summer, one of the
hottest in decades, I put him on the bathroom 
floor, gave him water and pills, he wouldn't eat, he
wouldn't touch the water, I dipped my finger into it
and wet his mouth and I talked to him, I didn't go any-
where, I put in a lot of bathroom time and talked to 
him and gently touched him and he looked back at
me with those pale blue crossed eyes and as the days went
by he made his first move
dragging himself forward by his front legs
(the rear ones wouldn't work)
he made it to the litter box
crawled over and in,
it was like the trumpet of possible victory
blowing in that bathroom and into the city, I
related to that cat-I'd had it bad, not that
bad but bad enough 
one morning he got up, stood up, fell back down and
just looked at me. 
""you can make it,"" I said to him. 
he kept trying, getting up falling down, finally
he walked a few steps, he was like a drunk, the
rear legs just didn't want to do it and he fell again, rested,
then got up. 
you know the rest: now he's better than ever, cross-eyed
almost toothless, but the grace is back, and that look in
his eyes never left… 
and now sometimes I'm interviewed, they want to hear about
life and literature and I get drunk and hold up my cross-eyed,
shot, runover de-tailed cat and I say,""look, look
at this!"" 
but they don't understand, they say something like,""you
say you've been influenced by Celine?"" 
""no,"" I hold the cat up,""by what happens, by
things like this, by this, by this!"" 
I shake the cat, hold him up in 
the smoky and drunken light, he's relaxed he knows… 
it's then that the interviews end
although I am proud sometimes when I see the pictures
later and there I am and there is the cat and we are photo-
graphed together. 
he too knows it's bullshit but that somehow it all helps.     Show analysis"

6,The Shower,we like to shower afterwards like the water hotter than she and her face is always soft and peaceful and she will wash me first spread the soap over my balls lift the balls squeeze them then wash the cock hey this thing is still hard then get all the hair down there the belly the back the neck the legs grin grin grin and then wash her first the cunt stand behind her my cock in the cheeks of her ass gently soap up the cunt hairs wash there with soothing motion linger perhaps longer than necessary then get the backs of the legs the ass the back the neck turn her kiss her soap up the breasts get them and the belly the neck the fronts of the legs the ankles the feet and then the cunt once more for luck another kiss and she gets out first toweling sometimes singing while stay in turn the water on hotter feeling the good times of love miracle then get out it is usually mid afternoon and quiet and getting dressed we talk about what else there might be to do but being together solves most of it for as long as those things stay solved in the history of women and man it is different for each for me it is splendid enough to remember past the memories of pain and defeat and unhappiness when you take it away do it slowly and easily make it as if were dying in my sleep instead of in my life amen show analysis,"we like to shower afterwards
(I like the water hotter than she)
and her face is always soft and peaceful
and she'll wash me first
spread the soap over my balls
lift the balls
squeeze them,
then wash the cock:
""hey, this thing is still hard!""
then get all the hair down there,-
the belly, the back, the neck, the legs,
I grin grin grin,
and then I wash her. . .
first the cunt, I
stand behind her, my cock in the cheeks of her ass
I gently soap up the cunt hairs,
wash there with a soothing motion,
I linger perhaps longer than necessary,
then I get the backs of the legs, the ass,
the back, the neck, I turn her, kiss her,
soap up the breasts, get them and the belly, the neck,
the fronts of the legs, the ankles, the feet,
and then the cunt, once more, for luck. . .
another kiss, and she gets out first,
toweling, sometimes singing while I stay in
turn the water on hotter
feeling the good times of love's miracle
I then get out. . .
it is usually mid-afternoon and quiet,
and getting dressed we talk about what else
there might be to do,
but being together solves most of it
for as long as those things stay solved
in the history of women and
man, it's different for each-
for me, it's splendid enough to remember
past the memories of pain and defeat and unhappiness:
when you take it away
do it slowly and easily
make it as if I were dying in my sleep instead of in 
my life, amen.     Show analysis"
