	I am silver and exact. I have no preconceptions.
	Whatever I see I swallow immediately
	Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.
	I am not cruel, only truthful‚
	The eye of a little god, four-cornered.
	Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall.
	It is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long
	I think it is part of my heart. But it flickers.
	Faces and darkness separate us over and over.
	Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me,
	Searching my reaches for what she really is.
	Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon.
	I see her back, and reflect it faithfully.
	She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands.
	I am important to her. She comes and goes.
	Each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness.
	In me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman
	Rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.     Show analysis"

	I have done it again.
	  One year in every ten
	  I manage it——
	 
	  A sort of walking miracle, my skin
	  Bright as a Nazi lampshade,
	  My right foot
	 
	  A paperweight,
	  My face a featureless, fine
	  Jew linen.
	 
	  Peel off the napkin
	  0 my enemy.
	  Do I terrify?——
	 
	  The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?
	  The sour breath
	  Will vanish in a day.
	 
	  Soon, soon the flesh
	  The grave cave ate will be
	  At home on me
	 
	  And I a smiling woman.
	  I am only thirty.
	  And like the cat I have nine times to die.
	 
	  This is Number Three.
	  What a trash
	  To annihilate each decade.
	 
	  What a million filaments.
	  The peanut-crunching crowd
	  Shoves in to see
	 
	  Them unwrap me hand and foot
	  The big strip tease.
	  Gentlemen, ladies
	 
	  These are my hands
	  My knees.
	  I may be skin and bone,
	 
	  Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.
	  The first time it happened I was ten.
	  It was an accident.
	 
	  The second time I meant
	  To last it out and not come back at all.
	  I rocked shut
	 
	  As a seashell.
	  They had to call and call
	  And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.
	 
	  Dying
	  Is an art, like everything else,
	  I do it exceptionally well.
	 
	  I do it so it feels like hell.
	  I do it so it feels real.
	  I guess you could say I've a call.
	 
	  It's easy enough to do it in a cell.
	  It's easy enough to do it and stay put.
	  It's the theatrical
	 
	  Comeback in broad day
	  To the same place, the same face, the same brute
	  Amused shout:
	 
	  'A miracle!'
	  That knocks me out.
	  There is a charge
	 
	  For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge
	  For the hearing of my heart——
	  It really goes.
	 
	  And there is a charge, a very large charge
	  For a word or a touch
	  Or a bit of blood
	 
	  Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.
	  So, so, Herr Doktor.
	  So, Herr Enemy.
	 
	  I am your opus,
	  I am your valuable,
	  The pure gold baby
	 
	  That melts to a shriek.
	  I turn and burn.
	  Do not think I underestimate your great concern.
	 
	  Ash, ash —-
	  You poke and stir.
	  Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——
	 
	  A cake of soap,
	  A wedding ring,
	  A gold filling.
	 
	  Herr God, Herr Lucifer
	  Beware
	  Beware.
	 
	  Out of the ash
	  I rise with my red hair
	  And I eat men like air.     Show analysis"

Any more, black shoe
In which I have lived like a foot
For thirty years, poor and white,
Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.

Daddy, I have had to kill you.
You died before I had time—-
Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,
Ghastly statue with one gray toe
Big as a Frisco seal

And a head in the freakish Atlantic
Where it pours bean green over blue
In the waters off the beautiful Nauset.
I used to pray to recover you.
Ach, du.

In the German tongue, in the Polish town
Scraped flat by the roller
Of wars, wars, wars.
But the name of the town is common.
My Polack friend

Says there are a dozen or two.
So I never could tell where you
Put your foot, your root,
I never could talk to you.
The tongue stuck in my jaw.

It stuck in a barb wire snare.
Ich, ich, ich, ich,
I could hardly speak.
I thought every German was you.
And the language obscene

An engine, an engine,
Chuffing me off like a Jew.
A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.
I began to talk like a Jew.
I think I may well be a Jew.

The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna
Are not very pure or true.
With my gypsy ancestress and my weird luck
And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack
I may be a bit of a Jew.

I have always been scared of you,
With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.
And your neat mustache
And your Aryan eye, bright blue.
Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You——

Not God but a swastika
So black no sky could squeak through.
Every woman adores a Fascist,
The boot in the face, the brute
Brute heart of a brute like you.

You stand at the blackboard, daddy,
In the picture I have of you,
A cleft in your chin instead of your foot
But no less a devil for that, no not
Any less the black man who

Bit my pretty red heart in two.
I was ten when they buried you.
At twenty I tried to die
And get back, back, back to you.
I thought even the bones would do.

But they pulled me out of the sack,
And they stuck me together with glue.
And then I knew what to do.
I made a model of you,
A man in black with a Meinkampf look

And a love of the rack and the screw.
And I said I do, I do.
So daddy, I'm finally through.
The black telephone's off at the root,
The voices just can't worm through.

If I've killed one man, I've killed two—-
The vampire who said he was you
And drank my blood for a year,
Seven years, if you want to know.
Daddy, you can lie back now.

There's a stake in your fat black heart
And the villagers never liked you.
They are dancing and stamping on you.
They always knew it was you.
Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through.     Show analysis"

Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in
I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly
As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.
I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.
I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses
And my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons.

They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff
Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.
Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.
The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,
They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,
Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,
So it is impossible to tell how many there are.

My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water
Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.
They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.
Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage ——
My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,
My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;
Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.

I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat
Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.
They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.
Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley
I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books
Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.
I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.

I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted
To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
How free it is, you have no idea how free ——
The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.
It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them
Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.

The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.
Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe
Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.
Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.
They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down,
Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour,
A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.

Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.
The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,
And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow
Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,
And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.
The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.

Before they came the air was calm enough,
Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.
Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.
They concentrate my attention, that was happy
Playing and resting without committing itself.

The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.
The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;
They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,
And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes
Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.
The water I taste is warm and salty, like the sea,
And comes from a country far away as health.     Show analysis"

It is shimmering, has it breasts, has it edges?

I am sure it is unique, I am sure it is what I want.
When I am quiet at my cooking I feel it looking, I feel it thinking

'Is this the one I am too appear for,
Is this the elect one, the one with black eye-pits and a scar?

Measuring the flour, cutting off the surplus,
Adhering to rules, to rules, to rules.

Is this the one for the annunciation?
My god, what a laugh!'

But it shimmers, it does not stop, and I think it wants me.
I would not mind if it were bones, or a pearl button.

I do not want much of a present, anyway, this year.
After all I am alive only by accident.

I would have killed myself gladly that time any possible way.
Now there are these veils, shimmering like curtains,

The diaphanous satins of a January window
White as babies' bedding and glittering with dead breath. O ivory!

It must be a tusk there, a ghost column.
Can you not see I do not mind what it is.

Can you not give it to me?
Do not be ashamed—I do not mind if it is small.

Do not be mean, I am ready for enormity.
Let us sit down to it, one on either side, admiring the gleam,

The glaze, the mirrory variety of it.
Let us eat our last supper at it, like a hospital plate.

I know why you will not give it to me,
You are terrified

The world will go up in a shriek, and your head with it,
Bossed, brazen, an antique shield,

A marvel to your great-grandchildren.
Do not be afraid, it is not so.

I will only take it and go aside quietly.
You will not even hear me opening it, no paper crackle,

No falling ribbons, no scream at the end.
I do not think you credit me with this discretion.

If you only knew how the veils were killing my days.
To you they are only transparencies, clear air.

But my god, the clouds are like cotton.
Armies of them. They are carbon monoxide.

Sweetly, sweetly I breathe in,
Filling my veins with invisibles, with the million

Probable motes that tick the years off my life.
You are silver-suited for the occasion. O adding machine——-

Is it impossible for you to let something go and have it go whole?
Must you stamp each piece purple,

Must you kill what you can?
There is one thing I want today, and only you can give it to me.

It stands at my window, big as the sky.
It breathes from my sheets, the cold dead center

Where split lives congeal and stiffen to history.
Let it not come by the mail, finger by finger.

Let it not come by word of mouth, I should be sixty
By the time the whole of it was delivered, and to numb to use it.

Only let down the veil, the veil, the veil.
If it were death

I would admire the deep gravity of it, its timeless eyes.
I would know you were serious.

There would be a nobility then, there would be a birthday.
And the knife not carve, but enter

Pure and clean as the cry of a baby,
And the universe slide from my side.

Hustled a gull flock to flap off the sandspit.

His body beached with the sea's garbage,
